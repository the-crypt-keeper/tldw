Velez's strategy:\n   - Velez tries to steal an elephant back from Yo, but only hits it once before realizing his mistake and going back for two more hits.\n   - This leaves him with only three HP on his scout, making him vulnerable to being lamed by Yo.\n   - Velez sees that Yo is chasing down the scout and knows about the gold, which could be a big focus on this map.\n   - However, running through the forest is scary for Velez, and he may regret this decision.\n   - With Yo knowing the situation perfectly, he knows he can win any feudal age engagement here.\n   - Velez is down one HP, making it difficult for him to met an arm rush."

                    "answer": "The game between Yo and Veliz was a close match, with both players showing excellent strategies. Yo played as the Tatars, while Veliz played as the Ethiopians.\n\nIn the early stages of the game, Velez stole an elephant from Yo's base, which caused him to lose his HP scout. This decision proved to be risky for Velez, as it left him vulnerable without a full HP scout. Despite this setback, Velez managed to steal another elephant from Yo's base, giving him two elephants in total.\n\nYo decided not to lame on the map, choosing instead to take the sheep and maintain his full HP scout. This decision allowed him to gather more resources and build up his army faster than Velez.\n\nVelez attempted a fast castle, but it was unsuccessful due to Yo's superior positioning and resource management. As a result, Yo was able to counterattack and destroy Velez's castle before it could become fully functional.\n\nThroughout the game, both players focused heavily on the gold deposits located near their bases. They also engaged in skirmishes over control of the berry bushes, which provided additional food resources.\n\nIn the end, Yo emerged victorious, defeating Velez by a narrow margin. This match showcased excellent strategic play from both players, demonstrating the importance of resource management, scouting, and effective counter-strategies in Age of Empires II."

                    "answer": "The game is played on the \"Tatar\" map, which has a unique resource distribution that favors the Tatar civilization.\n\nThe players begin by introducing themselves and their respective civilizations. Yo plays as the Tatars with red colors, while Veliz plays as the Ethiopians with blue colors. They then analyze the initial situation of the game, noting that Velez took an elephant from Yo's base but decided to return it after realizing he had only hit it once.\n\nYo's decision not to lame the elephant back is based on his desire for a full HP scout, which would allow him to see how many resources Velez has on wood and other resources. This advantage outweighs the potential benefits of stealing the elephant back.\n\nVelez's decision to take the elephant in the first place may have been influenced by his civilization's ability to get 50% more food from sheep, making up for some of the lost resources from not having the elephant. However, this advantage is offset by the fact that Yo is also Tatars, giving him 50% more food from his own sheep.\n\nThe discussion continues with analysis of Velez's possible fast castle strategy, which could be a significant advantage if successful. However, they both agree that it would be risky on this particular map due to its layout and resources.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo sees the gold miner near his base and realizes that Velez's scout is weakened. He decides not to chase down the scout but instead focuses on defending his base and preparing for a feudal age engagement.\n\nVelez, now down one HP, struggles to defend himself against Yo's advances. He eventually loses his scout and is forced to retreat, leaving Yo with a clear advantage going into the feudal age.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript provides valuable insights into professional Age of Empires II strategies and tactics, highlighting the importance of resource management, scouting, and early game decisions in determining the outcome of a match."

They both agree that it is crucial to have one, especially when playing against an opponent who has one.\n\nIn the game, Velez starts off by building his Town Center (TC) and then moves on to build a Barracks. He also builds a Scout Tower near his TC. Meanwhile, Yo builds his TC and a Barracks in the south.\n\nVelez sends his scout to explore the map and discovers that there are no enemy units nearby. He decides to move his scout towards the gold mines, which he believes will be safe since Yo's scout is not present. However, Yo manages to catch up with Velez's scout and kills it just as it reaches the gold mines.\n\nWith no scout left, Velez now has to rely on his own vision to make strategic decisions. He continues to build his army while keeping an eye on Yo's movements. Yo, on the other hand, builds a second Barracks in the north and a range tower near his TC.\n\nVelez eventually sends his scout back out to explore the map again. This time, he discovers that Yo has built two ranges near his TC and some walls in the south. With this information, Velez realizes that Yo is likely going for a Skirmisher opening.\n\nDespite losing his scout twice, Velez continues to play aggressively and pushes into Yo's base. He takes down one of Yo's ranges and destroys some of his buildings. However, Yo counters by sending his own army to attack Velez's base.\n\nThe game ends with Velez winning the match 3-1, showcasing his excellent strategic decision-making skills despite being at a disadvantage due to lack of vision."

Velez, the player in blue, scouts the enemy base early on and discovers their Town Center (TC) location. He then builds his own TC near the center of the map, securing the gold mines on both sides.\n\n3. Yo, the player in red, builds his TC further away from the center but closer to the resources on one side of the map. This allows him to gather more resources faster than Velez.\n\n4. Velez sends his scout towards Yo's base, but it gets hit by a spearman and loses three health points. Despite this setback, Velez continues to scout and discovers Yo's barracks and range tower locations.\n\n5. Yo builds a second range tower in the north, which could be used for Skirmisher rush or as a counter to Velez's range towers. However, he does not take any gold from the nearby berries, leaving them vulnerable to attack.\n\n6. Velez builds walls around his berries to protect them against range units, while also constructing a second range tower in the south. This gives him a clear advantage in long-range combat.\n\n7. As time goes on, Yo becomes increasingly frustrated with his lack of scouting capabilities due to losing his scout early on. He eventually decides to push forward with his army, hoping to find out more about Velez's strategy.\n\n8. Velez takes advantage of Yo's aggression by baiting him into taking a spearman hit, allowing him to see Yo's production and range towers. With this information, Velez can better prepare for future engagements.\n\n9. Finally, after several minutes of discussion between the players, Yo loses his scout permanently when it gets hit by a spearman. This leaves him blind and at a significant disadvantage compared to Velez, who has been able to observe Yo's entire base throughout the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this match showcases the importance of scouting in Age of Empires II and how effective it can be when used properly. Velez's ability to maintain control over the central island and secure key resources allowed him to build up a strong economy and military force, ultimately leading to victory over Yo."

They mention that Yo will likely play into skirmishers and cavaliers, giving away archer sips to take cavalry sips, while playing against Velez's archer-heavy composition.\n\nThe game starts with both players starting on stone, but Velez has a slight advantage in resources due to his faster start. Yo builds up his economy quickly, focusing on Town Centers and Skirms, while Velez builds up his army with crossbows and Mangonels.\n\nVelez makes the first move by sending his crossbows to attack Yo's Town Center, which is defended by Skirms. This trade results in a loss of one Town Center for Yo. However, Velez loses several units in the process, including his Mangonel.\n\nYo responds by building more Town Centers and Skirms, as well as researching Archery. He also sends out scouts to gather information about Velez's position. Meanwhile, Velez continues to build up his army with crossbows and Mangonels, while also researching Arbalest.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez manages to destroy one of Yo's Town Centers, leaving him with three remaining. Yo counters this by sending out his Skirms to engage Velez's crossbows, resulting in a successful trade for Yo.\n\nWith time running out, Velez decides to go for a fast imp, which would give him an immediate target against Yo's fourth Town Center. However, Yo manages to kill the Mangonel before it can fire, preventing Velez from completing the imp.\n\nIn conclusion, the game ends with Velez having lost one Town Center and most of his army, while Yo still has three Town Centers and a strong military presence. The commentators discuss how Yo's strategy of countering Velez's archer-heavy composition worked well for him, despite losing one Town Center early on."

Yo decides to give away his archer sips to Velez in exchange for cavalry sips, which was part of their pre-draft strategy. This allows Yo to counter Velez's strong archer play with his own counter units.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo begins to build a castle in the north, while Velez focuses on building an imp in the south. Yo also takes control of the range, but Velez manages to destroy it using a Mangano. In response, Yo kills the Mangano, demonstrating that there are two counters to the fast imp: all-in casting or getting a castle up and turtling until you have an imp yourself.\n\nVelez eventually gets arbalest, giving him a significant advantage over Yo's crossbows. However, Yo still has time to build a castle and potentially flee if necessary. The composition of Velez's army will likely be crossbows, arbalest, and bomber cannons since he cannot get a castle up.\n\nThroughout the discussion, the analysts highlight interesting gameplay events and strategies used by both players. They also point out that Yo did not research any armor upgrades during his skirmish, which may hinder his ability to imp quickly.

This shows that Age of Empires II has many different strategies and counters within its gameplay.\n\n5. The players debate whether there are two counters to the fast imp: all-in casting or getting a castle up and turtling until an imp is available. Both agree that Yo will likely go for the castle option due to his stone age resources.\n\n6.

One player suggests that Velez could push up the middle with his Ethiopian death ball, but the other player thinks it would be risky due to Yo's forward castle on Velez's resources.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to analyzing Yo's strategy of building a forward castle on Velez's resources. Both players agree that this is typical of Yo's playstyle, as he often builds forward castles on other players' resources. However, they also point out that this particular castle is risky because Velez has an imp nearby and a crossbow army waiting for him.\n\nOne player suggests that Velez should consider buying some food and selling some wood to go up himself, while the other player recommends idle talent centers and waiting for the imp. They discuss the importance of not committing to both strategies, as it can lead to losing both the army and the imp.\n\nYo continues to build his forward castle, and Velez eventually decides to send his army back to Yo's base. However, Yo takes out more than one range and the siege workshop, forcing Velez to make another siege workshop. This causes Velez's economy to become even more fragile, which leads to questions about whether or not he should have sent his army earlier.\n\nThe conversation then turns to discussing Yo's expansion plans on the left side of his base. He is trying to expand precautionarily, knowing that Velez may be moving towards there with bloods. Meanwhile, Velez is only now getting out of bomber cannon, so Yo has time to prepare for any potential attacks.\n\nOne player suggests continuing with skirmishers but also having the option to go for light cav, as Tatars have silk armor. Another player agrees that having some light cav on the field would be beneficial.\n\nYo continues to push down Velez's TC, causing damage to various buildings such as a barracks, archer range, and TC itself. Velez had enough of this and decided to find some damage on the top side with arbalests, but where do you even go? There's a TC no matter which way you turn.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to discussing how Velez's eco looks fragile compared to Yo's, despite being in him and Yo being in castle. They attribute this to the psychological pressure caused by Yo's forward castle, which made Velez feel like he needed to break into Yo's base immediately.\n\nFinally, Velez breaks into Yo's base with his army, and they begin fighting. Yo masses scrimmages from two ranges, while Vlez comes in and has enough for a castle. The question arises: where will Velez place his castle? He chooses to place it in the bottom, which the players agree is a typical Yo castle placement.\n\nThe transcript ends with the players discussing how Yo likes to build forward castles on other players' resources, and how this particular castle is risky due to Velez's imp nearby and crossbow army waiting for him."

They mention that when they think Spanish, they think fast castle and Conquistadors. However, if you lose all your fish early, you won't have enough food to either go fast castle or make Conquistadors.\n\nThe context then shifts to an analysis of a game being played by Falez and Yo. Falez is playing as the Spanish and Yo is playing as the Finns. The Finnish player has a big advantage because he knows where Falez's dock is, while Falez doesn't know where Yo's dock is. This gives the Finnish player a significant edge in terms of knowledge.\n\nFalez tries to scout the shoreline with sheep to find Yo's dock, but he misses it completely. He might never see it because he scouted before the house was there, meaning the dock was being built or the villager was somewhere else. This creates an interesting situation for Falez, who knows there's a dock but may second-guess himself and not realize it's right at the start.\n\nThe commentators discuss how difficult Dark Age on New Mad is due to many unknowns, such as not knowing where bores are. They also point out that when in doubt, you always go water against Spanish anyways. Falez will most likely be going faster, so he should probably find that dock.\n\nOne positive aspect for Falez is that he won't randomly switch his dock to another point in the map since he's on the big lake. This means he'll be close to Yoh's fish regardless of whether he scouts it or not.\n\nYoh knows where the TC is for Falez, as he lost a sheep next to Falez's town center. Falez has had a few more sheep now, but he's been scouting mainly the shoreline. Despite this, he still hasn't found the dock.\n\nThe commentators discuss the strategies available to both players. For Falez, he has the choice to go wagons or not, depending on how close Yoh is to his town center. He also has the option of guard tower defense, but it has fallen out of favor recently in the meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript provides a detailed analysis of a game being played between Falez and Yo, highlighting interesting gameplay events and strategies. It emphasizes the importance of scouting in Age of Empires II and discusses various options available to each player based on their position in the game."

This information gives Falez an advantage in knowing where Yo's fish are located, which could potentially help him decide whether to go for water or continue with his plan of going conquistadors in the castle age.\n\nAnother interesting strategy discussed by the players is the idea of using a fishing ship to scout the shoreline for Yo's dock. This would allow Falez to gain more knowledge about Yo's position and resources, giving him a better chance at winning the match.\n\nThe players also discuss the importance of prioritizing land over water if Falez knows that Yoh is close to his town center. This means that he may need to consider building wagons or guard towers for defense instead of focusing solely on water units like fire galleys.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides valuable insights into professional Age of Empires II strategies and highlights some key decisions made by both players during the match."

Falez places his first dock near his town center, while Yo builds a second dock closer to Falez's first dock. This causes Falez to rethink his position and place another dock further away from Yo's second dock.\n\nYo then sends a villager to scout Falez's base, discovering his third dock. He also finds out that Falez has a fishing ship nearby. In response, Yo uses his fishing ship to block the path between Falez's docks, preventing him from accessing the fish.\n\nFalez repairs his docks, but makes a mistake by repairing the wrong one, losing a free fire gallery in the process. Yo takes advantage of this by sending more villagers to harass Falez's base.\n\nBoth players continue to build up their armies, with Falez focusing on cavalry and Yo prioritizing infantry. They eventually reach imperial age, and the game enters a grush war phase.\n\nThroughout the game, both players make strategic decisions based on their opponent's actions. For example, when Falez discovers Yo's second dock, he realizes that he needs to place another dock further away to avoid being blocked by Yo's fishing ship.\n\nIn conclusion, the game showcases a highly competitive match between two skilled players using different strategies and adapting to each other's moves.

With no variation in his strategy, Vales finds himself completely chilled up, unable to make any significant progress against Yo's relentless assault.\n\nWith both players now at castle age, Vales finally gets his stone and begins building a castle. However, Yo anticipates this move and sends his own Magna Carta to contest the position. In a tense moment, Vales misfires twice, allowing Yo to dodge out of harm's way and ultimately win the castle war. Without the stone for a castle, Vales must either buy one or place a defensive structure, giving Yo the upper hand in the match."

Introduction: The transcript begins with an introduction to the match between Yo and Velez, which is part of a tournament called \"The G.\"\n\n2. Game 1: In game 1, Yo wins the coin toss and chooses the map \"Nomad.\" Both players start off aggressively, with Velez building a tower near Yo's base. Yo counters by building a tower of his own and sending out scouts to explore the map. Velez then builds a second tower near Yo's main base, preventing him from expanding further.\n\n3. Game 2: In game 2, Velez chooses the map \"Bay,\" which has a unique resource called \"berries\" that can be milled for food. Velez takes an early lead in resources and population, while Yo struggles to find a good spot to build his town center. Eventually, Yo manages to establish a foothold on the map and starts producing units. However, Velez continues to dominate the economy and eventually defeats Yo.\n\n4. Game 3: In game 3, Yo chooses the map \"Cup,\" which features a large central lake surrounded by landmasses. Both players begin aggressively, with Velez once again taking an early lead in resources and population. Yo tries to counter by building a castle near the center of the map, but Velez quickly destroys it. As the game progresses, Velez expands onto all available landmasses, while Yo struggles to keep up. Ultimately, Velez wins the game and takes a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n5. Game 4: In game 4, Velez chooses the map \"Island,\" which features two small islands connected by a bridge. Both players start off cautiously, with Velez focusing on building up his economy and Yo trying to establish a strong defense. As the game progresses, Yo manages to build a castle on one of the islands, but Velez quickly destroys it. With both players now focused on attacking each other's main bases, the game becomes a stalemate. Eventually, Velez breaks through Yo's defenses and defeats him, winning the game and the series 3-1.\n\n6. Analysis and Conclusion: Throughout the match, both players demonstrate excellent strategic thinking and adaptability. Velez consistently takes advantage of Yo's mistakes and capitalizes on them, while Yo shows great resilience and never gives up despite being behind in the series.

Velez (Yo) opens with two docks and no more villagers, while United (Mr. Yeo) opens with a single dock and one villager. Yo's strategy is to delay his dock construction, which will be faster than Mr. Yeo's, in order to piss him off and disrupt his plans.\n\n3. Mr. Yeo responds by sending his villager to the right side of the map to find a shore fish, delaying his dock even further. He also sends another villager to sneak into the enemy base and deny them their first dock.\n\n4. Velez counters this by sending a villager back to his original starting location to build a second dock, which will be faster than Mr. Yeo's delayed dock.\n\n5. Both players discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using galleys versus fires on the water. They agree that galleys are better for kiting and running around, but if there's a landing situation, fires would be preferable.\n\n6. Mr. Yeo eventually builds his first dock and begins producing units, switching immediately to land afterward. Velez continues to produce docks and transports, focusing on water defense.\n\n7. As the game progresses, Mr. Yeo expands his territory on the left side of the map while Velez focuses on defending his home base and expanding on the right side.\n\n8. Throughout the match, both players make strategic decisions based on their respective civs' strengths and weaknesses, leading to an exciting and competitive game."

His goal is to keep Vales busy with his scout while running away with a full HP scout himself. He also uses forward villagers to mess up Vales' plan.\n\n2. Vales' strategy: Vales is playing as the Saracens and wants to go for two docks and either fires or galleys. However, Yo's forward villager and sneaky play make it difficult for him to achieve this. Additionally, Yo's house-walling in a villager for Vales adds another layer of complexity to the game.\n\n3. Interesting gameplay events: The discussion highlights several interesting gameplay events, such as Yo's forward dock idea, which could potentially disconnect his fire from his dock; Vales' long run to kill the scout; and Yo's house-walling in a villager for Vales.

They mention that Yo is notorious for sneaky plays like forward villagers and forwards, which can be used to mess up an opponent's plan.\n\nHarrow then points out that Vales has to constantly think about Yo's potential moves due to the presence of the forward villager. This makes it difficult for Vales to build his own houses without worrying about losing them to Yo's forward villager.\n\nSato suggests that Yo could potentially dock right next to his dock, but Harrow argues that this would disconnect Yo from his fish and make it harder for him to defend them. Instead, Harrow believes that docking at home would be more strategic if Yo wants to go to the water.\n\nYo agrees with Harrow's assessment and builds his second dock near his house. However, both players notice that Vales's docks are also disconnected, making it difficult for either player to effectively fish.\n\nAs the feudal stage progresses, Vales manages to kill Yo's scout, giving him a slight advantage in terms of idle time and loom. Despite this, Yo continues to run away with a full HP scout, which gives him a higher chance of survival in engagements.\n\nVales eventually catches up to Yo's scout and kills it, gaining another advantage over Yo. In response, Yo walls in one of Vales's villagers between two trees, effectively trapping it inside his territory.\n\nThe game continues with both players taking hits back home while trying to maintain their respective docks and fish.

They note that without a scout, neither player can effectively kill the opponent's villagers, making it a trade-off of idle time and loom commitment. One player mentions that Vales has committed to loom, while Yo has a higher HP scout.\n\nThey then discuss how Yo is happy to run away with a full HP scout or not, depending on the situation. This leads them to talk about how Yo is known for sneaky tactics like forward villagers and forwards, which can disrupt an opponent's plan. They agree that these forward villagers give a ton of value in terms of messing up your opponent's plan, especially when there are weird maps in tournaments.\n\nOne player suggests that Yo could build his second dock right next to his first dock, but another player points out that this would make it difficult for Yo to defend his own fish as well. Ultimately, they decide that docking at home makes more sense if Yo wants to go to the water.\n\nYo eventually builds his second dock, and both players discuss the strategic implications of this decision. The docks are somewhat disconnected from each other, meaning that wherever Yo fishes, he will have to deal with Vales's docks nearby.\n\nAs the game progresses, Vales manages to kill Yo's scout, which forces Yo to change his strategy. He decides to house-wall in one of Vales's villagers, essentially forcing Vales to either chase the villager or lose it. This move surprises both players, who comment on its effectiveness.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the players also discuss various strategies and counterstrategies, such as using galleys to kill the villager if necessary, building walls around the docks, and taking hits back home. They highlight the importance of scouting, forward villagers, and disconnected docks in this particular matchup.\n\nOverall, the transcript provides valuable insights into professional Age of Empires II gameplay and strategies, particularly on the \"Vales\" map.

                    "answer": "\n\n1. The first game discussed was a match between Vales and Yo, played on the map \"Valley of Kings.\" Yo's strategy involved denying the dock, delaying the dock, using the forward Ville, transitioning into eco behind, and throwing everything out this forward. This made for an entertaining game as it kept the viewer guessing what would happen next.\n\n2. The second game discussed was played on the map \"Coast to Mountains\" with Huns versus Poles. The Polish player had a very interesting strategy that allowed them to dominate virtually any civilization if given enough time. They were able to make so many units that it wasn't even down to a good KD; it was just making so many units.\n\n3. The casters also talked about how the Polish economy is insane and can be goth-like in some stages, where it's not even down to a good KD, but just making so many units.\n\n4. One of the casters regrets not giving more credit to the Polish player during a previous tournament because he thought they were a bad choice at the time. However, after seeing more players pick Poles and learn their strategies, he realized that maybe there was something to it.\n\n5. In conclusion, the transcript provided detailed information about two different games and strategies used by professional players in an Age of Empires II tournament."

Yo's late game is solid, but he doesn't have a dock on this map, which poses a risk.\n4. Velez has one eco up over his opponent because he already has a dock, while Yo hasn't built one yet. This could be difficult for Yo to come back from.\n5. The players discuss whether or not Yo will build a dock, considering he usually sends one villager this direction right away and builds the TC with the other ones. However, they believe that if Yo were to lose the camel there, it would have been a sick move.\n6. The players debate whether or not Yo's decision to not build a dock is an intelligent move or just a potato play.\n7. They also discuss the Maginot delete feature in Age of Empires II, which allows players to delete Mangonels on flat ground, doing the same amount of damage as when firing up the hill. They agree that this should be patched out, as it makes no sense.\n8. Finally, the players analyze a situation where Velez was able to delete a Mangonel on flat ground, making the Mangonel do more damage.

They then move on to analyze an ongoing game between Yo and Velez, who are playing as Poles and Mayans respectively.\n\nYo's strategy involves not building a dock initially, which gives his opponent an early economic advantage. However, this turns out to be a sneaky play by Yo, as he eventually builds a dock later in the game. This catches Velez off guard, allowing Yo to gain an economic advantage over his opponent.\n\nVelez scouts the shoreline with a camel, expecting no dock from Yo. If he loses the camel, it would have been a great opportunity for Yo to kill the camel and reveal his opponent's position. However, Yo garrisons there instead, suggesting that he may have known about the potential loss of the camel and planned accordingly.\n\nThe players discuss whether or not this is a 200 IQ play by Yo, but ultimately decide that it's likely just a potato move since they don't want to put him on too high of a pedestal. They also mention that Maginot delete should be patched out because it makes no sense for flat ground deletes to do the same amount of damage as hill deletes.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript provides insights into the strategies and tactics used by professional players in Age of Empires II, as well as their opinions on various aspects of the game."

This forces Yo to consider building his own dock later in the game, which would be unusual for this point in the match.\n\nAnother strategic decision made by Yo involves garrisoning a villager near the camel of Velez. The commentators believe that this was done intentionally to make Velez think that Yo would not be building a dock, allowing him to set up a sneaky second dock himself.\n\nVelez loses a villager to an elephant trap set by Yo, but manages to recover it quickly. He then sends a villager across the map to gather wood for his second dock, which will be crucial for maintaining his economic advantage over Yo.\n\nThe commentators discuss the potential removal of the Maginot delete bug, where Mangonels can delete each other on flat ground without any damage reduction. They agree that this is one of the dumbest things in the game and should be patched out.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides insight into the thought processes and strategies of two professional Age of Empires II players during a tournament match.

Yo prioritizes wood and gold, while Valise focuses on wood and stone. They both build a few scout units to explore the map and find each other's bases.\n\nYo sends his scouts to the north of the map, where he discovers an island with a large amount of fish. He decides to send two galleys to fish there, which will provide him with additional food resources. Meanwhile, Valise sends his scouts to the south of the map, where he finds a small island with some wood. He builds a house on this island to collect more wood.\n\nBoth players begin to expand their towns and build more units. Yo continues to focus on wood and gold, while Valise transitions to wood and stone. They both build barracks for infantry units and stables for cavalry units.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo realizes that he has a significant advantage in water resources due to the location of his base. He decides to use this advantage by sending a camel to scout the enemy base and then builds a dock for his galleys. This allows him to quickly gather fish from the nearby island, giving him a steady supply of food.\n\nValise notices Yo's strategy and decides to counter it by building a tower near his own base. This tower provides him with a defensive position against any potential attacks from Yo's galleys. Additionally, Valise begins to build archers, which are effective against Yo's galleys.\n\nYo responds to this threat by building a range tower near his base. This range tower can attack the enemy tower and potentially destroy it. However, Valise counters this move by building another tower closer to Yo's range tower. This creates a stalemate between the two players, as neither can effectively attack the other without risking their own towers being destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, Yo continues to gather fish from the nearby island using his galleys. He also builds a stable for cavalry units and begins to train them. Valise, on the other hand, focuses on building more archers and training them.\n\nAs the game progresses, both players continue to build up their armies and defend their bases. Eventually, Yo decides to make a risky move by abandoning his full walls and sending a spearman unit directly into the enemy base. This catches Valise off guard, and although he loses some villagers, he manages to hold off the initial attack.\n\nValise responds by sending a group of archers to attack Yo's barracks. This forces Yo to abandon his plans and focus on defending his base. The two players engage in a back-and-forth battle, with neither side gaining a significant advantage.\n\nEventually, Yo decides to change his strategy and focus on farming instead of direct confrontation. He builds a second stable for cavalry units and begins to train them. Valise, meanwhile, continues to build archers and trains them.\n\nAs the game enters its later stages, both players have built up substantial armies. Yo has a mix of cavalry, infantry, and archers, while Valise has mostly archers and cavalry. They continue to fight over control of the central area of the map, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage.\n\nIn the end, the game ends in a draw, with both players having equal scores. This demonstrates the skill and strategic thinking required to succeed in Age of Empires II tournament matches."

Velez sends his second scout to the north to scout for Valise's base. At this point, it becomes clear that Valise has not yet transitioned to land, giving Velez more time to prepare his defense.\n\n5.

He also sends a spearman to attack Valise's range tower, but it fails due to Valise's patience with his army.\n\n7. Valise attacks Velez's barracks with his archer, but misclicks and instead attacks the nearby town center. This gives Velez a heads-up about Valise's impending attack.\n\n8. Velez abandons the full walls around his barracks and rushes down the remaining walls, allowing him to defend against Valise's attack more effectively.\n\n9.

Yo mentions that he is feeling full work city over here, adding another full work, and going to place more farms.\n\nHara then asks whether or not Yo will add a third town center in a second, which would be better if he hadn't had to wall so close to the corner. Yo responds that he thinks three TCs would probably be better but that he doesn't want to have to wall so close to the corner.\n\nThe discussion continues as they analyze the positioning of Velez's units and the potential strategies he could employ. Hara points out that Velez might prioritize mining stone just in case the pressure from Yo builds up, but also notes that you don't really care for the fast imp as poles.\n\nYo agrees that Velez should prioritize mining stone and wonders what units to make here. He considers blasting straight up, but Hara suggests that Velez could deny the town center placement with just two archers. However, Hara believes that Velez noticed the town center being placed and is heading over with a knight and cab archer.\n\nYo then realizes that there is a hole for the knight, which allows Velez to snowball this situation. With three town centers, Velez has an advantage due to having not had fish for very long in the game. If the town center had gone up, it would have been even, but now that it won't go up, Velez takes the lead.\n\nHara prefers Velez's position because there is a hill at the top of the base, and scorpion hits are quite heavy. If Velez stays at the top, he has the hill bonus. However, Hara isn't sure if that's enough incentive to stay there, as Yo has one monk, three Scorpions, and one Mangonel.\n\nYo agrees that the perfect amount of siege for Velez would be one Mangonel, three Scorpions, and one monk. There's nothing Yo can do about it, but he might consider going for a siege workshop. Hara thinks that siege is good to apply pressure anyways, even though there's a castle on one side.\n\nThey both agree that poles are extremely tricky to play against in this situation, especially since Yo gave away the second safety by giving away poles. Hara notes that early Imperial age is where poles can shine, but after Sriracha privileges, things get pretty hot with 50-60-70 cavalier.\n\nThe transcript ends with Hara and Yo discussing the importance of respecting the civ and its unique tech."

He then says that he thinks you should definitely slow it on the farms before touching that tech, but Velez responds by saying that maybe it's a bit much for the poles.\n\nYo then suggests going winged tussar here, honestly, because cavalier ends the game. However, Velez disagrees, saying that no, it doesn't. They continue discussing their strategies, with Yo arguing that if you go cavalier, then you save up a bunch of gold and flood with your gold bank. Velez counters this by saying that you can actually go winged tussar because cavalier is not strong enough, and then you save up a bunch of gold and flood with your gold bank.\n\nYo then explains his reasoning behind going winged tussar: because you open tussar, you spam your food (excuse me), and then switch to arbalest and boom, I have a perfect comp. If I go cavalier, then what do I do after? Then I have to get the tussar attack later, so. Velez responds by saying that because you open tussar, you spam your food (excuse me), and then switch to arbalest and boom, I have a perfect comp. If I go cavalier, then what do I do after? Then I have to get the tussar attack later, so.\n\nYo continues his argument, saying that if he loses this game, he might talk some shit, but come back to him, bro. I might talk some shit, but come back to me, you know what I mean? Velez agrees, saying that he has no, you know, you could pick your save every game, I'd probably still lose, so I don't really know.\n\nThey then discuss whether or not Velez should turn this into a competition, as Yo would lose, but cavalier's on the way, and he thinks Velez is gonna expect this, but he hasn't seen additional barracks for him yet. Are you worried about that? Yo responds by saying that he almost feels like against pulls, you don't want barracks. I think what you should do is definitely go cav archers, and if anything, you wanna wall the defensive castles. That's better than halvs, because they're missing the last armor, so you actually just need to survive, and halv isn't really the way to do it.\n\nVelez then mentions that Yo had early cavalier in an instance against ACCM, and also an instance against Say My Name, so the last two players he played, and what he would do is, I think this is the smartest thing you can do, he wouldn't address the castle in this situation, he wouldn't address the cav archers. His first wave loops around a raid, and it's super tough to deal with raids, like, how are you gonna wall this map, right? You would have to stonewall the whole map, which is probably unrealistic, and so if Yo could get that in, and then his follow-up army go into where that castle is, I think that would maybe be his best decision.\n\nYo then points out that Velez has four relics, granted, they are in the front monastery, which is always a little bit scary, but if you can hold that position, man, four relics is a really good win condition to have in a game like this, where you are behind, but if you just hold, four relics is not bad.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez sends out his cavalier, 148 speed, they're pretty tanky, but they are missing that last armor, which will hurt their techiness in the long run, for sure, against cavaliers.

One player, Yo, is using a cavalier flood strategy while the other player, Velez, has a massive CA army.\n\nYo sends his cavalry to attack and take down a castle belonging to Velez. This causes Velez to lose some of his population, which could potentially be problematic for him in the long run. However, Yo continues his cavalier flood strategy without any sign of tech switching.\n\nVelez counters by sending out crop rotation, but it is unclear if this is worthwhile considering that Pause hasn't yet been researched. The discussion then shifts to the fact that Yo hasn't been engaging against cav archers, which could become an issue later on when Velez has 70 fully upgraded cav archers.\n\nYo eventually manages to take down another castle belonging to Velez, allowing him to send more cavalry towards the enemy base. At this point, both players agree that Yo should switch to arbalest or at least Skirmishers, as light cavalry from Velez are already present on the field.\n\nVelez, meanwhile, is concerned about getting light cavalry due to his limited food supply and the fact that he's sending everything on a wooden gold at the moment. He could potentially lose some TCs if he doesn't manage his resources carefully.\n\nYo takes advantage of this situation by sending all his cavalry to attack the main town center of Velez, which is defended only by a few cav archers. The trebuchets will also take out the town center, giving Yo control over the area.\n\nThe discussion then turns to whether or not Velez should switch into light cavalry, given his limited resources.

He suggests that it would be more annoying to lose the relics than to build a new monastery. The second player, Yo, agrees that it's more annoying to lose the relics but says that it's also annoying to multitask.\n\nPause then points out that Yo is using a cavalier flood and two trebuchets to attack Velez's castle, which is a massive CA.

This means that if Yo doesn't engage against them, Velez could get heavy cav archers and possibly even death balls.\n\nYo responds by saying that Velez's position is weak because he lost to Veles in the front and Yo can take them. However, if Yo does take them, he will have five Veles. Pause agrees that this would be bad for Velez but thinks that Yo should switch to arbalest or at least skirmishers instead of continuing with cavalier.\n\nYo counters by saying that there are light cav from Veles already on the field, so getting light cav might not be a good idea for Velez due to his lack of eco. Pause agrees and suggests that Veles might not even have enough resources to fully upgrade his light cav.\n\nPause then points out that Yo is about to drop another castle, which means the trebuchets will take out the town center. He also notes that Yo has a lot of cav archers at the main TC, all chasing the cavalier. Pause believes that this makes it difficult for Velez to react and suggests that Yo might not be able to afford full upgrades on his light cav.\n\nYo counters by saying that he doesn't think Veles should counterattack with the cav archers; instead, he should send them back and try to defend. Pause agrees and adds that there are a lot of cavalier on the field right now.\n\nIn conclusion, both players discuss strategies during the match, including Yo's use of a cavalier flood and trebuchets to attack Velez's castle, as well as Pause's suggestion that Velez should switch to arbalest or skirmishers instead of continuing with cavalier. They also debate whether or not it's worth getting crop rotation for Pause and whether or not Velez can afford full upgrades on his light cav."

Yo continues his aggressive play by sending more cavalry archers and cavalry to attack Velez's base, eventually taking down one of his castles.\n\n5. Velez responds by sending a large force of light cavalry, but they are unable to reach Yo's main base due to the distance between them.\n\n6. Yo takes advantage of this situation by building a trebuchet at his main base and using it to destroy Velez's town center, eliminating his economy.\n\n7. Despite losing his economy, Velez manages to hold off Yo's attacks long enough for his new economy to grow. He then switches to a tech-heavy strategy, focusing on arbalests and skirmishers.\n\n8. Yo continues his aggressive play, sending more cavalry archers and cavalry to attack Velez's remaining forces. However, Velez counters effectively with his new arbalests and skirmishers, causing significant damage to Yo's army.\n\n9.

Yo's early imp timings and momentum: Yo was able to gain an early advantage by having good imp timings and momentum, which allowed him to extend his lead further.\n\n2. Veles' composition is better but he's down to 5 relics: While Veles has a better composition with cavalier, skirmisher, and trampoline armor, he is down to 5 relics compared to Yo's 6 relics. This puts Yo at a slight advantage in terms of resources.\n\n3. Cavalier everywhere: Yo has been able to spam cavalier endlessly due to Viv's unmatched eco, making them the best Viv in the game according to the players.\n\n4. Light cav makes sense for Veliz: The players suggest that light cavalry would be a better choice for Veliz than heavy cavalry archers, as they can run into areas where the CA cannot go.\n\n5. Skirmishers help against CA raids: With poles not getting the final armor upgrade on their skirmishers, they will also help defend against CA raids.\n\n6. Stonewalls from Veliz: Veliz tries to counter Yo's skirmishers by building stone walls near the shoreline, but this doesn't seem to be effective as Yo continues to push forward.\n\n7. Defend CA, attack with light cav: The players advise Veliz to defend his CA and attack with light cavalry instead of trying to attack with CA, as the light cav can run into areas where the CA cannot go.\n\n8. Running to the back of the farm: When discussing how to counter Yo's cavalier, the players mention that light cavalry could have run to the back of the farm where the CA couldn't, highlighting the importance of mobility in this matchup.\n\n9. Final armor upgrade for poles: If Veliz had the final armor upgrade for his poles, it might have made them the best Viv in the game, according to the players.\n\n10. Pulse farms: The players discuss camera farms, slap farms, and pulse farms, with the latter being the best one due to its unmatched eco provided by Viv.\n\n11. Trampoline armor: The trampoline armor is considered a good move by the players, although it may not be enough to turn the tide in Veliz's favor.\n\n12. Good job from Veliz coming in with light cav: Despite the challenges faced by Veliz, the players acknowledge that he is making some good moves, such as bringing in light cavalry to counter Yo's skirmishers.\n\n13. Problem with Veliz's play: The players point out that Veliz is trying to attack with CA instead of defending them and attacking with light cavalry, which is the wrong idea given the advantages of mobility possessed by light cavalry.\n\n14. Strategies for Veles: The players suggest that Veliz should focus on defending his CA and attacking with light cavalry, while also considering switching to a different strategy if necessary.\n\n15. Yo's strategies: Yo's strategies include using his superior mobility to find the right time to commit to forward castles and take space, as well as running to Veles' base when he sees cavalier.\n\n16. Momentum plays a crucial role: Throughout the discussion, the players emphasize the importance of momentum in Age of Empires II, especially during early imp timings.\n\n17. Final thoughts: The players conclude that while Veles has a better composition, Yo's early imp timings and momentum give him an edge in terms of resources and overall gameplay. They also highlight the importance of mobility and adaptability in this matchup, with light cavalry playing a crucial role."

They discuss how having eight control groups would be ideal for managing different angles and patrols.\n\n2. Yo's impressive opening to Feudal Age: Velez was expecting to win water against the poles, but Yo never gave him that opportunity. This shows how important it is to take advantage of your opponent's mistakes and capitalize on them.\n\n3. Late-game mistakes from Velez: Although there weren't many mistakes in the mid-game, some late-game decisions by Velez may have cost him a little bit. It could also be attributed to good play from Yo.\n\n4. Yo's castle near stone mines and gold mines: Both players agree that Yo loves having his castle near the stone mines and gold mines, which gives him an advantage in terms of resources.\n\n5. Velez's chasey style: One player suggests that Velez could have played more tightly on defense, being less chasey, but ultimately gives credit where credit is due for Yo's macro play in the late game with his military.\n\n6. What if Velez had no relics? The discussion turns to what might have happened if Velez didn't have those four relics in the middle, as well as his cav archer in position where the most forward castle is for Yo in the north. This leads to speculation about whether or not Yo would struggle without the poles bonus, allowing Velez to keep his hussar and potentially turn the tide of the game.\n\n7. Yo's perfect farm placement: Both players note that Yo has placed all of his farms around full works, and every single one is near a full work. This demonstrates the power of the poles bonus and how it can help players make efficient use of their resources.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides valuable insights into the strategies used by two professional Age of Empires II players during a tournament match.

They agree that it is very strong and can be easily abused by making farms around the Town Center first and then transitioning to other buildings.\n\nThe game starts with Mr. Yo playing as the Mayans and Velez playing as the Aztecs. Both players have 100 military, but Velez has an advantage in population with 160 pop compared to Yo's 100 pop.\n\nIn Feudal Age, Yo makes a quick move by sending his cavalry towards Velez's base while also building a siege tower. This catches Velez off guard, who was expecting to win water against the poles. However, he quickly adapts and builds a castle near his gold mines.\n\nThroughout the mid-game, both players make steady progress in their eco development. Yo continues to build cavalry and siege towers, while Velez focuses on producing hussars and archers.\n\nAs they enter Castle Age, Yo gains control of the middle area between the two bases, which gives him access to more resources and allows him to expand his army even further. He also manages to break through Velez's outer walls using his siege towers, allowing his cavalry to attack directly into the base.\n\nVelez tries to counter this by building a second castle near his gold mines, but it doesn't provide enough protection against Yo's relentless assault. Meanwhile, Yo continues to produce cavalry at an impressive rate, eventually reaching 213 units.\n\nWith his cavalry overwhelming Velez's defenses, Yo begins to push into the enemy base. Velez attempts to defend with his hussars and archers, but they are no match for the sheer numbers of Yo's cavalry.\n\nAs the game enters its late stages, Yo's cavalry swarm into Velez's base, destroying everything in their path. With no hope of recovery, Velez surrenders, giving Mr. Yo a decisive victory.\n\nThroughout the game, Yo demonstrates excellent macro play, consistently producing cavalry at a high rate and maintaining a strong economy. His use of the poles bonus is also crucial to his success, allowing him to quickly build farms around his Town Centers and generate additional resources.\n\nVelez shows good micro play throughout the game, especially during the early stages when he successfully defends against Yo's initial attacks. However, he struggles to keep up with Yo's relentless production of cavalry and ultimately falls victim to his opponent's superior strategy."

The casters discuss the pros and cons of the two militia Drush strategy, with one caster stating that he used to think it was bad but now isn't so sure.\n\nIn the game itself, Yo engages in a big engagement against Velez, which initially looks good for him but ultimately results in his defeat due to being surrounded and unable to fight effectively. The casters analyze this situation and agree that if Yo's unit had engaged earlier, the outcome might have been different.\n\nVelez continues to build up his forces, adding men at arms and a Jaguar attacking as one militia. The casters discuss the potential downside of this strategy, as losing the Jaguar could be detrimental. However, they also acknowledge that Velez shouldn't lose the game based on this decision alone.\n\nOverall, the transcript provides detailed insights into the strategies and gameplay events of a professional Age of Empires II match, as well as the opinions and analysis of experienced casters."

One player mentions that they prefer to take advantage of their bonuses as fast as possible, which leads to an analysis of the \"fast castle\" strategy in Age of Empires 2.\n\nThe player then explains that if you were to go fast castle with Burmese, you would be delaying Feudal age, which delays your free wood upgrade and extra attack on your infantry. They also mention that Yo is not expecting this and could potentially lose more units than usual due to the weakness of his scout and militia.\n\nThe conversation continues with another player expressing their surprise at how greedy it is to just go out and take a deer, but the first player argues that it's still fine since Yo noticed. However, the second player points out that the bumping villagers are stupid, and the first player agrees.\n\nAs the game progresses, the players discuss Yo's position and how he has completely abandoned the fast castle approach. They analyze his eco grid and note that he got both eco grids, indicating that he has completely committed to fuel phase. The first player praises this move by Yo, calling it high-level pressure.\n\nThe discussion then turns to Velez's position and how he placed two mills on separate areas of hunt. The players agree that this is exactly what you would want on Yucatanen, as it allows for quick access to wood. They also note that one range is massive, countering the archers while allowing them to attack freely.\n\nVelez then backs up a little earlier than expected, which the players believe may be because he doesn't expect to do much damage and wants to turn his attention towards the wood. Despite this, they acknowledge that his eco will likely be better at home, with 500 food already collected.\n\nThe conversation continues with the players analyzing Yo's position and noting that he can't take any of Velez's hunt, while Velez can take all of Yo's. They also discuss how Turks cannot go elite skirmishers, making them vulnerable against crossbows.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the players provide detailed explanations of various strategies and gameplay events, highlighting interesting aspects of the game and providing insight into their own thought processes."

He builds two mills on separate areas of hunt, which allows him to quickly increase his food count.\n\nYo continues with his fast castle strategy but eventually realizes that Velez has abandoned it and backs up a little earlier than expected. This gives Velez more time to build up his eco at home, where he already has 500 food.\n\nAt this point, Velez could potentially force more damage on Yo if he wanted to, but instead, he turns his attention towards wood production. Yo then goes for a deer, which seems greedy but might be worth it considering the situation.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez continues to build up his eco while Yo struggles to keep up due to his lack of resources.

They analyze Yo's decision to abandon the fast castle approach after noticing that Velez had placed two mills on separate areas of hunt. This shows that Yo recognized the high-level pressure from Velez and adjusted his strategy accordingly.\n\n3. Velez builds a blacksmith casually, which demonstrates his confidence in his position and ability to counter any potential attacks from Yo.\n\n4. Velez turns his attention towards wood while maintaining pressure on Yo's base. This shows that he is aware of the importance of securing resources and maintaining pressure on his opponent.\n\n5. Yo backs up a little earlier than expected, possibly due to feeling baited by how close off the map was. This indicates that Yo may have underestimated Velez's capabilities and overestimated his own.\n\n6. Velez continues to apply pressure on Yo's base, eventually forcing him to retreat further. This demonstrates Velez's superior positioning and strategic thinking compared to Yo.\n\n7. Despite having no farms, Velez could cook up at 1630 if he really wanted to, showing his eco is looking better at home. However, this would leave him vulnerable to counterattacks from Yo.\n\n8. If Velez opens crossbow against Yo, it would likely result in Yo's death as Turks cannot go elite skirmishers. This highlights the importance of timing and countering your opponent's moves effectively.\n\n9. Yo's food count is rising rapidly, which is surprising given that Velez has been applying pressure on his base. This shows that Yo has found a way to generate food quickly despite being under pressure, indicating his adaptability and resourcefulness.\n\n10. In conclusion, this transcript highlights the importance of recognizing your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, adapting to changing situations, and maintaining pressure throughout the game. Both players demonstrate excellent strategic thinking and execution during this match, making for an exciting and informative discussion."

Velez's counter-strategy: Velez sees the Mangano advantage and decides to click elite skirmishers (elite skirms), which is one of the worst feelings according to the commentators. This means that he has three town centers, but his eco is better than Yo's.\n\n3. Yo's response: Despite being down in economy, Yo responds well by building a third range and a TC on the front line. He also builds a stable for his CA.\n\n4. Velez's commitment: The commentators discuss whether Velez over or under committed to this match, considering his investment in crossbows, upgrades for units, and siege workshop. They conclude that he didn't have enough crossbows to make Yo respect him at all times, so maybe the Knights were not the right choice.\n\n5. Yo's next steps: Yo continues to build his economy and gets a second town center up, as well as a big shot there. He takes it and moves forward, forcing Velez to respect the Cab Archer presence.\n\n6. Velez's hole: The commentators point out that Velez actually had a hole in his defense, which he walling up now. However, they note that it doesn't really matter because a monastic is placed in the center, and it just has to happen every game.\n\n7. Yo's strategy after redemption: At this point, the commentators suggest that Yo should go for a three TC room, wait, defend with Mangano's, and then have as soon as possible to have redemption come in. This makes Mangano defense a lot worse.\n\n8. Velez's response: Velez hopes to defend with his own siege and use the Cab Archers elsewhere, but the second redemption comes in, making Mangano defense even more difficult. The only monk can convert siege, but he dies easily due to low health.\n\n9. Final thoughts: The commentators are impressed with Yo's response to the situation, as he was initially in big trouble but managed to turn things around.

They observe that he is sneaking a forward siege workshop, which could be crucial in his upcoming fight against Velez. They also note that Yo has been focusing on repairing his town center despite having no repairville, indicating good micro skills.\n\nVelez's strategy is discussed next, including his decision to respect the no-sanctity monk because he believes it will convert if shot at. This leads to a discussion about the potential benefits of Forward Castle for both players. While Velez would benefit from having a castle on the hill between the two TCs, Yo would need to commit 15 light cav just to ensure its completion.\n\nYo's micro skills are praised again as he uses light cav to snipe along the map and even shoots magnum dust first to make scrims go back. Velez is flustered in the middle of the map, and both players agree that he should at least build a defensive castle somewhere.\n\nThe transcript ends with a summary of the current state of the game, with Velez having a 1200 stone advantage and Yo hoping to win a fight soon before continuing with castle construction."

He manages to sneak a forward siege workshop past Velez's defenses, allowing him to build a castle quickly. This puts pressure on Velez, who responds by repairing his Town Center (TC) from the hill. However, Yo continues to push forward with his light cavalry, eventually taking out the monk that was protecting the TC.\n\nVelez then makes a crucial mistake by committing too many resources to repairing his TC instead of focusing on building up his economy. This gives Yo an opportunity to attack the unprotected TC, but he fails to take advantage of it due to poor micro-management.\n\nIn the second half of the transcript, Velez recovers from this setback and begins to focus on building up his economy. He also starts using skirmishers effectively, pushing them out of range when necessary. Meanwhile, Yo continues to struggle with his micro-management, resulting in several lost opportunities for counterattacks.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez builds a Forward Castle on the hill between the two main bases. This allows him to control the middle area of the map and prevent Yo from advancing further. With this new position, Velez can now focus on expanding his economy and building up his army.\n\nThroughout the match, both players demonstrate excellent micro-management skills and strategic thinking. However, Yo ultimately falls short due to his inability to maintain consistent micro-management throughout the game. Velez, on the other hand, capitalizes on Yo's mistakes and uses them to his advantage, eventually securing a decisive victory."

The other player, playing as Turks, believes that if Burmese continues to invest in light cab units, they will eventually win the game.\n\nBurmese then makes an interesting decision by placing a forward castle on one of their hills, which could potentially be used to counter any future attacks from Turks. However, this decision comes at the cost of losing some gold due to the high price of the castle.\n\nTurks responds by making more crossbow units, despite having already invested heavily in them earlier in the game. This decision raises questions about whether or not Turks is trying to create a position for another forward castle or simply trying to counter Burmese's light cab units.\n\nAs the game progresses, both players continue to make strategic moves and counter each other's actions. Burmese places another forward castle on another hill, while Turks builds up their army with more light cab units and siege weapons like trebuchets and cannon galleons.\n\nThe discussion between the two players becomes increasingly intense as they analyze each other's strategies and discuss possible outcomes. Ultimately, Turks believes that Burmese should win the game if they continue to invest in light cab units, but also expresses concern that Yo (the Turks player) may be able to make a comeback with his own strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript provides a detailed account of the back-and-forth strategies employed by both players during the course of the game.

After a few minutes of play, Velez realizes that he needs to get a forward castle first to counter Yo's light cab advantage. He decides to build one at home and then look for a good spot to place it.\n\nYo notices this strategy and immediately deletes his first forward castle placement because he knows that Velez will be able to take it out with his siege weapons. Instead, Yo goes for the second forward castle location, which is closer to his base. However, Velez also sees this opportunity and places his own forward castle there, denying Yo the chance to get it.\n\nAt this point, Velez has extended his lead over Yo in terms of resources and army strength. Despite this, Yo continues to fight back and does not give up hope. He begins producing more light cab units and eventually gets a forward castle of his own.\n\nThroughout the game, both players make strategic decisions about what units to produce and when to attack or defend. Velez initially focuses on making crossbows and pikemen, but later switches to making more crossbows in an attempt to counter Yo's light cab advantage. Yo, on the other hand, produces mostly light cab units and some siege engines like trebuchets and cannon galleons.\n\nOne interesting strategy discussed by the commentators is that if Yo were in Turks position right now, he would go all-in on Castle Age and use light cab and cab archers to buy time while waiting for imp. This would allow him to avoid racing into Imperial Age and potentially losing the game. However, since Yo is currently playing as Burmese, he doesn't have access to the are blessed technology needed for this strategy.\n\nAs the game progresses, both players continue to make strategic decisions and adjust their strategies based on the situation.

They mention that it is a tournament match on Frisia, which is known for its hybrid map features.\n\nThe players in this match are Yo and Velez, who both start on opposite sides of the map. Yo loses his first pig to Velez, but manages to steal back some pigs from Velez's base. However, he also loses several deer to Velez's scouting efforts.\n\nIn the early game, Yo sends forward villagers to deny Velez's docks, while Velez builds up his economy and expands his territory. Both players focus on wood production and gathering resources.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo starts building archers and man-at-arms, while Velez continues to expand his territory and build more units. The commentators discuss the importance of the hunt for both players, as it provides food underneath their Town Centers.\n\nYo eventually takes the hunt, but loses water access due to this decision. He also loses several pigs to Velez's scouting efforts. Despite these setbacks, Yo manages to send forward villagers to deny Velez's docks again, forcing him to rebuild them.\n\nIn the late game, both players have built up significant armies and continue to fight over resources. Velez manages to take out Yo's boar underneath his Castle, further weakening Yo's economy.\n\nDespite being behind in resources, Yo manages to click up and send forward villagers to deny Velez's docks once again. This forces Velez to rebuild his docks yet again, costing him valuable time and resources.\n\nThe commentators discuss the strategic significance of this move by Yo, as it not only denies Velez's docks but also forces him to spend time and resources rebuilding them. They note that this could potentially be a turning point in the game, as every minute counts on Frisia.\n\nAs the game enters the endgame, both players continue to fight over resources and build up their armies. Velez manages to take out Yo's last pig, leaving him without any additional pigs needed for a fast castle.\n\nIn the end, Velez emerges victorious, winning the tournament match. The commentators praise both players for their strategic play and discuss the importance of resource management and timing on Frisia."

At this point, Yo is behind in resources and needs to make up for it quickly. He decides to send all his remaining villagers forward, including his idle villager, to gather more resources and catch up with Velez.\n\nIn mid-feudal, Velez has a slight advantage over Yo in terms of resources. However, Yo manages to take the hunt, which could potentially give him an edge in food production. Velez also loses some pigs to Yo's scouting, further narrowing the resource gap between them.\n\nThroughout the game, both players display excellent micro management skills, with their villagers constantly gathering resources and defending against enemy attacks.

He starts by walling up towards docks and towering the stone, then he commits to more towers.\n\n2. Yo's strategy: Yo is also playing a hybrid map with Portuguese and Japanese civilizations, but his focus seems to be on water control. He catches the archers moving forward and sends villagers and archers to attack the fire galley, killing it. However, he loses a scout due to pressure from Velez.\n\n3. Villager attack on the fire galley: One of Yo's villagers attacks the fire galley, killing it. This action shows that even though Yo has a strong water army, he still values land units for their damage potential.\n\n4. Fishing ships alive against two dogs: Despite being outnumbered by two dogs, Yo's fishing ships manage to survive somehow thanks to the Portuguese bonus. This demonstrates the power of the Portuguese bonus in defending against enemy units.\n\n5. Velez's horse-calling: Velez calls in a horse cavalry unit, showing that he is prepared to switch from a water-focused strategy to a land-focused one if necessary.\n\n6. Switching off of water: The discussion between the players highlights the importance of switching off of water when playing hybrid maps. While fishing ships can be useful in certain situations, they are not reliable enough to rely on as a primary strategy. Switching to farms at some point is a good move, especially when facing an opponent who is likely to go for a castle drop.\n\n7. Repairing the fire ship: Yo's tower veils repair his fire ship in the back, which is hilarious but also annoying for Velez. Two veils might actually make the difference, plus the archers focus down the repair ville. This shows how important it is to have multiple veils in a game, as they can help repair damaged units quickly.\n\n8. Sacrificing a lot to kill the villager: Velez runs back with the villager, sacrificing a lot to kill the villager there. This shows that sometimes it's worth sacrificing resources or units to achieve a strategic goal, such as preventing your opponent from getting an advantage.\n\n9. Fire galleys going down: Despite losing the scout, Yo manages to win the water engagement and trade it for all his land army. The fire galleys go down, so Yo will win the water engagement and trade it for all his land army.\n\n10. Tower behind Velez's base: At the end of the transcript, Velez builds a tower behind his own base, possibly as a defensive measure against any future attacks from Yo. This shows that even though Velez lost the initial engagement, he is still capable of adapting and making strategic decisions to protect his base.\n\nIn conclusion, this transcript highlights several interesting gameplay events and strategies used by both players during the tournament match. It showcases the importance of switching off of water when playing hybrid maps, using multiple veils effectively, sacrificing resources for strategic goals, and adapting to changing circumstances throughout the game."

For example, he rushed the counter tower behind the wood line instead of waiting for a better opportunity to build it.\n3. The forecast at T90 will be crucial for both players. If Yo can get control of the water and forecast right outside Velez's gold, it would be a huge position advantage for him.\n4.

Fire galleys actually do very well against fire ships, which is something that both players should keep in mind during their battles.\n7. Although Velez placed his castle slightly further back than expected, it still allows him to control the waterway and secure the gold.

Portuguese fishing ships have more hit points than other civilizations' fishing ships, which gives Yo an advantage in naval battles.\n\n3. Yo's castle placement allows him to control the waterway and secure the gold, putting pressure on Velez's economy.\n\n4. Velez makes a questionable stable choice by going nice with Japanese units instead of using them defensively.\n\n5. Yo demonstrates excellent micro-management skills by repairing his villagers immediately after they are damaged, ensuring that they continue working efficiently.\n\n6. Fire galleys do well against fire ships, so Velez should consider using them to counter Yo's fire ships.\n\n7. The game becomes close as both players make strategic decisions, but ultimately, Yo's aggressive playstyle pays off, and he wins the match."

He then sends out two Monks to scout for resources while also mining stone. His opponent, Yoh, builds a Castle and an Orkengun in his base as well.\n\nVelez notices that Yoh has a monk to get the relic, so he decides to drop the Town Center (TC) and build a second Castle. This move surprises Yoh, who immediately reacts by sending Villagers to attack the newly built TC. However, Velez microes his knights perfectly, killing both of Yoh's Villagers.\n\nYoh continues to push forward with his army, eventually reaching the gold mine near Velez's second Castle. Velez responds by sending more Monks and a Knight to defend the gold mine. Despite this, Yoh manages to capture the gold mine and begins mining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Velez has been building up his economy, producing Elite teams and food. He also buys 100 stone for a potential third Castle. However, he doesn't seem to have a long-term game plan at this point.\n\nYoh, on the other hand, appears to be focused on the Orkengun micro, which could be problematic for him if he doesn't kill fish or villagers. He also saves resources for the Fast Dimp, but doesn't seem to be rushing it just yet.\n\nVelez makes a risky move by going for a double forward castle, which would be extremely powerful if successful. However, Yoh counters this aggressive play by picking off fishing ships in the north and buying food.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez redeems one of his Monks against Yoh's Orkenguns, but this trade isn't as favorable as it would be against Mangunels. Yoh then drops a Feitoria or two, giving him some eco advantage.\n\nIn a crucial moment, Yoh sends Villagers forward to drop a Castle right on top of Velez's gold mine. Velez responds with a few Monks, a Knight, and one Mangunel. However, Yoh's Castle isn't that far forward, making it difficult for Velez to stop it.\n\nUltimately, Yoh successfully drops the Castle on the gold mine, gaining access to the valuable resource. With this victory, Yoh secures a significant advantage in the match."

Repairing the castle: Velez should prioritize repairing his main town center's castle to delay the inevitable loss of his economy.\n\n5. Factorio from Yoh: Yoh uses Factorio to create additional resources, allowing him to continue producing fast Imps even after losing some of his farms.\n\n6. Strategic importance of taking out the castle: Taking out the enemy's castle is more important than dive bombing their town centers, as it gives the opponent a chance to build a castle themselves and potentially counterattack.\n\n7.

He also has a large military force, including Bombard Cannons, which are affected by Ballistics. His opponent, Velez, is playing as the Monks and has converted some of Yoh's organs into monks.\n\n2. Outposting: Both players engage in outposting to gain an advantage over their opponent. Yoh outposts on the right side of the map while Velez outposts on the left side. This helps them gather information about each other's movements and prevent any sneaky plays from happening.\n\n3. Population management: Yoh's Feitorias take up 20 pop space, but he still has more effective pop due to his large military force. On the other hand, Velez's population is inflated because of the Fatorias, but he doesn't have enough military power to push back Yoh's advances.\n\n4. Conversions: Velez converts two knights and starts converting organs into monks, hoping to get the siege against Yoh. However, Yoh can always make more siege units if needed, and he also has a tech switch on the cards.\n\n5. Nomad map: It seems that Yoh loses only on the Nomad map, which is his best map according to the commentators. The reason for this could be that Velez has a better understanding of the map and knows how to counter Yoh's strategies on it.\n\n6. Last game of the tournament: With both players trying their best not to resign, the match becomes intense. Velez converts more monks than expected, and the organ guns slowly disappear. However, Yoh eventually wins the game with a score of 5-1.\n\n7. Feitoria strategy: Some people argue that putting down Feitorias is a math problem, but the commentators believe it's a practicality solution. You don't need to put your villagers on resources; you just put down the Feitoria. It's less efficient than villagers, but it's infinite.\n\n8. Pop space management: Yoh has 120 pop space taken up by Feitorias and 55 villagers. He has around 30 pop space for military, which isn't much. If he doesn't finish the game soon, he could lose it.\n\n9. Velez's strategy: Velez goes Pikeman, Cara, and even has 30 military of his own. If he pushes back these castles, he's still alive in the game. However, Yo should have finished this game by now, but he's lost a lot of organ guns and doesn't have the pop space anymore.\n\n10.

This change allowed him to effectively counter Velez's Monk army, as the Galley units could easily destroy the Monks due to their high hit points.\n\nThroughout the match, both players demonstrate excellent micro management skills, with Velez successfully defending against multiple attacks from Yo's forces. However, despite his best efforts, Velez ultimately falls victim to Yo's superior economy and military might, losing the game 10-2."

Velez, the blue player, builds a Castle in his base to protect his economy from Yo's aggression.\n3. Yo, the red player, builds a Feitoria (a special building that provides extra population) and an Organsmith. He also sends out Monks to convert enemy units.\n4. Velez counters by sending out Lycans to attack the Monks and destroy the Feitoria. This causes Yo to lose some population and resources.\n5. Yo then builds a Bomber Cannon and a few more Organsmiths to counter the Lycans.\n6. Velez continues to send out Lycans and converts them into Hourglasses, which are powerful units that can quickly take down buildings.\n7. Yo responds by building a Gallium (a ship with a cannon) and switching his army to Light Cavalry.\n8. Velez loses two Relics due to a mistake while trying to eject Monks from his base.\n9. Yo's strategy involves over-Feitoria-ing, which means he builds multiple Feitorias on his map. This gives him a large population advantage over Velez.\n10. Despite losing two Relics, Velez continues to fight back with Hourglasses and other units.\n11. As the game progresses, Yo loses one of his Castles but manages to build another one in its place.\n12. Both players continue to engage in intense battles, with Velez eventually taking out all of Yo's Feitorias.\n13. In the end, Yo wins the match after successfully defending his remaining Castle and eliminating Velez's main base."

                    "answer": "The Resurgence is a tournament hosted by Jordan \"Hera\" Walker, featuring some of the top Age of Empires II players in the world. The finals were between Yoan \"Yo\" Kouli and Vales \"Vales\" Benevolent, with Yo emerging victorious 5-1.\n\nThe first game saw both players start off strong, but it was Vales who took an early lead after pushing his sheep into Hera's base and destroying his Town Center. However, Yo managed to recover quickly and eventually pushed his own sheep into Vales' base, destroying his Town Center as well. With both players having lost their Town Centers, they transitioned into Castle Age. In the end, Yo won the game due to better micro management and more efficient use of resources.\n\nIn Game 2, Vales opted for a Feitoria strategy while Yo went for a standard Galleon rush. Despite being outnumbered, Vales managed to hold off Yo's initial attack and even counterattack, forcing Yo to switch to a different strategy. The game ended in a draw after both players ran out of time.\n\nGame 3 saw Vales once again go for a Feitoria strategy, this time with more success. He was able to build up a large army and push into Yo's base, ultimately winning the game.\n\nFor Game 4, Yo switched things up by going for a fast fire ship strategy. This proved to be effective as he was able to take down Vales' castle and win the game.\n\nIn Game 5, Vales returned to his Feitoria strategy, but this time Yo countered with a fast fire ship and monk strategy. This combination proved too much for Vales, as Yo was able to take down his castle and win the game.\n\nWith the series tied at 2-2, Game 6 saw both players revert back to their original strategies from earlier games. Vales went for a Feitoria strategy while Yo went for a fast fire ship and monk strategy. Once again, Yo's combination proved to be more effective, allowing him to take down Vales' castle and win the game.\n\nWith the series now tied at 3-3, Game 7 saw both players make some adjustments to their strategies. Vales went for a Feitoria strategy with a focus on organ guns, while Yo went for a fast fire ship and monk strategy. This time, Yo's monks were able to break through Vales' defenses and take down his castle, securing the victory and the championship title.\n\nOverall, the Resurgence Finals showcased some incredible gameplay from both Yo and Vales. While Vales demonstrated the power of the Feitoria strategy, Yo showed that a well-executed fast fire ship and monk strategy could be just as effective. Both players displayed excellent micro management skills throughout the series, making for an exciting and competitive conclusion to the tournament."

                    "answer": "The summary below highlights interesting gameplay events and strategies:\n\n1. Feitoria is an OP concept, in my opinion, because it allows infinite resources.\n2. Vales forces organ guns even though his opponent has monks, which seems like a bad strategy.\n3. Yo falls off and falls behind multiple times throughout the best of nine series but always makes the game look easy with a clear game plan.\n4. Vales gets ahead in some instances, such as the Burmese Turks one, but Yo always finds a way to come back.\n5. Jordan does a great job hosting and casting the tournament despite playing himself.\n6. The Civ settings showcased in this event were really cool, allowing players to duke it out with different maps and civilizations.\n7. The resurgence tournament was overall solid, and there should be another edition down the line.\n8. Casting with Hara was fun, and they joked around about Wing Tussars."

                    "answer": "\n\n1. The first interesting gameplay event is when Vales forces organ guns on his opponent, Yo. This is an unusual strategy as arbalests would be more effective in ramming enemy ships due to their higher damage per shot. However, Vales' opponent has monks, which can counter the arbalests effectively. By forcing organ guns, Vales ensures that his opponent cannot use their monks to counter his attacks.\n\n2. Another interesting strategy discussed by the players is Feitoria's infinite resources concept. They believe that this makes Vales extremely powerful and difficult to defeat, as he doesn't need to worry about running out of stone or other resources.\n\n3. The players also discuss how Yo falls behind in some situations but always manages to make a comeback with a clear game plan. One such instance was when he lost five or six sheep in Hera lane, but managed to push all of his deer and end up shooting down the hunt, which was a big deal for Vales.\n\n4. In the final game of the tournament, Yo takes the victory 5-1 over Vales. Although Vales gets an invitation to the Red Bull Wollolo legacy tournament coming up in October, the players agree that Yo is still the winner of the resurgence tournament.\n\n5. The players praise Jordan for hosting the resurgence tournament and doing a great job at it despite playing and casting his own event. They also mention that combining playing and casting one's own event can be tiring and exhausting, so Jordan's performance in taking Vales to the final game yesterday was really impressive.\n\n6. Finally, the players highlight the Civ settings used in the resurgence tournament, which showcased different maps and civilizations. They enjoyed watching these games because they provided unique experiences compared to regular Age of Empires II matches."
